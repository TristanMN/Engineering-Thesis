# Engineering-Thesis
The project involves the development of a music game integrated with an electronic keyboard instrument, enabling the learning of music
through displayed synthesia from a selected music file. Points are scored during the repetition of the displayed key sequences,
allowing for competition. In addition to creating a functional game, this work is intended to convert a chosen song into MIDI format,
involving the detection and classification of tones using Fourier transform.

The project description is available in a PDF file.


To implement:
Come back and use machine learning
Delay of showing last key in group
Optimization of graphic
Automation of taking method to convert song

Concepts:
Config file saving last player and his settings
Learning mode
Pretty background with working piano
Button to changing speed of synthesia
Personalize colors
Personalize background
More graphics
Saving the playing of player and comprasion it with original synthesia song
Taking sound signal by microphone and make program working without audio interface
Graphic and convert methods to other instruments
